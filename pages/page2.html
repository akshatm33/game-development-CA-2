                <li>Start the game by flipping a card.</li> <br>
                
                <li>Then try to find another card that has
                    the same image as the <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp first. If you
                    can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped 
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspback with the face.</li> <br>
                
                <li>Try to remember these images as it 
                    becomes easier to find pairs &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe longer
                    you play.</li> <br>
                
                <li>There will be a timer of 60 seconds in
                   which you have to find the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppairs.</li> <br>
                
                <li>When you find all the pairs you will win
                the game.</li>
