# game-development-CA-2
Hi, I am akshat Maheshwari from Kalvium x RVU Squad 49. I've created a game for my game development CA-2, and it's called Match Up. This game is developed using various languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be played on both desktops and mobile devices.
Here are my Figma designs for this game which give a clear ideas for its design and working:
Desktop version - https://www.figma.com/proto/QNqiAxKJ7Xrh56rL61REk3/GAME-DEVELOPMENT-PART-2?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=1-2&viewport=354%2C206%2C0.27&t=gGoMcoGbDMLZXUBK-1&scaling=scale-down&mode=design

Mobile version - https://www.figma.com/proto/6G2tMQC0XqbYsUPviIyAOr/GAME-DEVELOPMENT-PART-1?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=1-21&viewport=194%2C252%2C0.45&t=UxxvVuEbMH9ynp7c-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&mode=design

Here is how the game works:-

In this game, the user must enter their Name and Nickname, which must be displayed in the game. Then the user goes to the instruction page where the user can understand the game and can easily play the game. After 
reading the instructions, the user has to click on the start button to start the game and then directly get into the game where the timer of 30 seconds will start automatically. Within that timer he has to complete the game if the user wins a statement will come Game Over! you won and if the user loses then it will show Game Over! play again
